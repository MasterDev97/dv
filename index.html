          <h3>Cricket</h3>
          <p>My favorite sport is cricket and of course it is the most loving game in India and you will find everyone passionate about it.
          I used to play cricket with my cousins and friends on a ground nearby my house. I'd earlier joined an academy for it too but left
        it for I was not able to make up my transportation there.</p>
